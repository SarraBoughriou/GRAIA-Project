Sustainable development aims to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This concept encompasses economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful tools that can significantly contribute to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). They offer innovative solutions to a wide range of global challenges, from optimizing energy use and reducing waste to enhancing agricultural productivity and managing natural resources more efficiently (Vinuesa et al., 2020; Rolnick et al., 2019).
However, the relationship between AI and sustainable development is twofold. While AI can drive progress toward sustainability, its development and deployment also pose substantial environmental challenges. The energy consumption associated with training and operating large AI models is considerable, leading to significant carbon emissions (Strubell, Ganesh & McCallum, 2019; Henderson et al., 2020). This paradox presents a crucial question: Can we unleash AI's potential without leaving a trail of environmental destruction?


At this crossroads, artificial intelligence presents a complex challenge. It offers solutions to climate change while contributing significantly to the problem itself. As Dhar points out, artificial intelligence is a fascinating figure in the fight against climate change: a potential hero offering solutions for a sustainable future but also a hidden villain contributing to the crisis it seeks to solve (Dhar, 2020).
One key issue in reducing AI's impact on the climate is quantifying its energy consumption and carbon emissions and minimizing them to make it greener. This is precisely the challenge addressed by the GRAIA project. Previous research has highlighted the significant environmental footprint of AI models, pointing to their energy-intensive nature across all stages—design, training, deployment, and use (Schwartz et al., 2020).

Recognizing this critical issue, GRAIA aims to shed light on the true environmental cost of AI algorithms. However, the project continues beyond measurement. The ultimate goal is to transform these models, making them greener, more resilient, and significantly less energy-hungry.
